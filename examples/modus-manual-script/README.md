# Modus: manual script

```shell
node ../../bin/webpack-dev-server.js --open
```

The webpack-dev-server client is added as script tag to the html page.

## What should happen

Try to update app.js by uncommenting some lines. The browser should reflect your changes.

If there is a compilation error or warning, this should be displayed in the CLI and devtools.
